# QUANT-TRAINING
Quantitative Finance Training
Goal is to create a repository of code for those who, like me, are leaning quantitative finance
and along with it the ability to code in python.

Since I'm new to python, there will be ample opportunities to imporve the code and add to it.
For those learning as well, hopefully these will provide some tools for learning.
